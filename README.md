This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Notes and observations
* To get up-and-running quickly, I used Create React App, so some technical decisions were made for me (I slightly prefer Mocha to Jest)
* I would've liked to style the app but ran out of time so it's p fugly. It's not mobile optimised by a long way but I've hidden the date fields on mobile to avoid it being too squished. Generally I'd break elements into their own rows on mobile, but the point here is a side-by-side so...
* Similarly, I initially wrote unit tests for logic and components but stopped in order to deliver the needs of the business quicker (same old story)
